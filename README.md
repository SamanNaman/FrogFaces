# FrogFaces
An exercise in learning to love life and use github all at the same time &lt;3

It is my hope that in this space I can both expand my skills and create or document some things that breath life into my own life. Hoping to include some art, some words that matter, and to learn how to make a design and website that is beautiful to navigate and soak in the sights and words... and sounds!
